# Data-Descriptors-Data-Topologies-and-AI-Networks
Exploring Data Aware Inference and Training Networks (DA-ITN), examining the role and significance of data descriptors and topologies, and discussing future research directions and opportunities for standardisation.

DA-ITN objectives include
1. Discover an optimised training path for AI models based on the knowledge information available at data nodes.
2. Exploite the training records of AI models to faciliate "subsequente training episodes" and optimize inference services.
3. Establish a new overlay network for AI model training, inference, and potentially agent to agent interaction.
